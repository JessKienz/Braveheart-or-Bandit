# Braveheart-or-Bandit
Interactive Text Game with Javascript and Terminal.

# Objective #
Effectively demonstrate bootcamp week two's learnings in Javascript with Node by developing a working game that properly utilizes functions, conditionals, defensive coding, control flow, and etc.

## Summary ##
Interactive adventure game that prompts input from the user via the terminal. The game's plot is determined by the user's responses. The questions test the user's morals and integrity to determine whether or not they're a Braveheart, a self-sacrifcing, prudent, hero, or a Bandit, who does whatever it takes to win, and keep themselves entertained along the way. Make it to the end to prove which one you are. You may surprise yourself.
